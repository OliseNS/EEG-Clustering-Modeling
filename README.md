# EEG Clustering and Model Evaluation

## Description

This repository contains a project focused on clustering EEG (electroencephalogram) features using KMeans, followed by performance evaluation and visualization. The goal is to assess different clustering metrics (e.g., cohesion, separation, silhouette score) and visualize the clustering results through various evaluation metrics.

The project includes:
- EEG data pre-processing
- Clustering using KMeans
- Evaluation of clustering performance (Silhouette Score, Cohesion, Separation, Recall, Specificity, F1-Score)
- Visual comparison of clustering results across different datasets
