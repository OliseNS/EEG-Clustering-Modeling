# EEG Clustering and Model Evaluation  

## Description  
This repository focuses on clustering EEG (electroencephalogram) features using the KMeans algorithm, alongside performance evaluation and visualization. The project includes feature generation, which transforms raw EEG data into meaningful representations for clustering. The primary aim is to assess clustering metrics (e.g., cohesion, separation, silhouette score) and visually compare results across datasets.  

### Key Features  
- **EEG Data Pre-processing**: Ensures clean and structured data for analysis.  
- **Feature Generation**: Extracts meaningful features from raw EEG signals to improve clustering performance.  
- **Clustering with KMeans**: Groups EEG features into distinct clusters.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics include:  
  - Silhouette Score  
  - Cohesion and Separation  
  - Recall, Specificity, and F1-Score  
- **Visualization**: Provides visual comparisons of clustering results across multiple datasets.

## Applications in Healthcare and Neuroscience  
This project provides a framework for analyzing EEG data, with potential applications in:  
1. **Brain Activity Analysis**: Detect patterns linked to cognitive states or neurological disorders.  
2. **Personalized Therapy**: Tailor neurofeedback and brain stimulation treatments.  
3. **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**: Enhance signal processing for assistive technologies.  
4. **Early Disorder Detection**: Identify subtle EEG markers of neurological conditions.  
5. **Drug Monitoring**: Evaluate treatment efficacy through brain activity changes.  
6. **Sleep Research**: Classify sleep stages or diagnose disorders.  
7. **Rehabilitation**: Assess brain recovery after injury or stroke.  

By combining feature generation, clustering algorithms, and evaluation metrics, this repository serves as a valuable tool for advancing neuroscience research and clinical applications.
